00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:18.048
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in a 1968 speech
where he reflects upon the civil rights

00:00:18.088 --> 00:00:19.088
movement, states,

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:20.550
in the end,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.911
we will remember not the words of our enemies,
but the silence of our friends.

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:31.274
As a teacher, I've internalized this message.
Every day, all around us,

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:35.756
we see the consequences of silence manifest
themselves in the form of discrimination,

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:38.759
violence, genocide, and war.

00:00:39.942 --> 00:00:44.723
In the classroom, I challenge my students to
explore the silences in their own lives through

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:50.645
poetry. We work together to fill those spaces,
to recognize them, to name them,

00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:53.765
to understand that they don't have to be sources
of shame.

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:58.786
In an effort to create a culture within my
classroom where students feel safe sharing the

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:03.828
intimacies of their own silences, I have four
core principles posted on the board that sits in

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:07.228
the front of my class, which every student signs
at the beginning of the year.

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:13.207
Read critically. write consciously, speak
clearly, tell your truth.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.450
I find myself thinking a lot about that last
point,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.069
tell your truth.

00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:22.471
And I realized that if I was going to ask my
students to speak up,

00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:28.073
I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest
with them about the times where I failed to do so.

00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:34.817
So I tell them that growing up, as a kid in a
Catholic family in New Orleans, During Lent,

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.341
I was always taught that the most meaningful
thing one could do was to give something up,

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:44.245
sacrifice something you typically indulge in
to prove to God you understand His sanctity.

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:49.489
I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries,
French kisses, and everything in between.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:51.490
But one year,

00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:57.915
I gave up speaking, figured the most valuable
thing I could sacrifice was my own voice,

00:01:57.995 --> 00:01:59.677
but it was like I hadn't realized

00:02:00.778 --> 00:02:06.548
that I had given that up a long time ago. I spent so
much of my life telling people the things they

00:02:06.587 --> 00:02:08.731
wanted to hear instead of the things they needed
to,

00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:13.382
told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience
because I still had to figure out being my own,

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:14.204
so sometimes,

00:02:15.287 --> 00:02:19.008
I just wouldn't say anything, appeasing
ignorance with my silence,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.872
unaware that validation doesn't need words to
endorse its existence.

00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:27.715
When Christian was beat up for being gay, I put my
hands in my pocket and walked with my head down as

00:02:27.754 --> 00:02:32.138
if I didn't even notice. Couldn't use my locker
for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded

00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:36.600
me of the one I had put on my lips. When the
homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes

00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:39.382
up, merely searching for an affirmation that he
was worth seeing,

00:02:39.622 --> 00:02:43.025
I was more concerned with touching the screen of
my apple than actually feeding him one.

00:02:43.064 --> 00:02:46.026
When the woman at the fundraising gala said, I'm
so proud of you.

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:49.127
It must be so hard teaching those poor,
unintelligent kids.

00:02:49.228 --> 00:02:53.209
I bit my lip because apparently we needed her
money more than my students needed their

00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:55.069
dignity. We spend so much time

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.170
listening to the things people are saying

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.611
that we rarely pay attention to the things they
don't.

00:03:03.024 --> 00:03:09.586
Silence is the residue of fear. It is filling
your flaws, gut-rich guillotine, your tongue.

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:13.429
It is the air retreating from your chest because
it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:16.931
Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is
Katrina.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.692
It is what you hear when there aren't enough body
bags left.

00:03:19.752 --> 00:03:24.655
It is the sound after the noose is already tied.
It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege.

00:03:24.914 --> 00:03:28.937
It is pain. There is no time to pick your battles
when your battles have already picked you.

00:03:29.016 --> 00:03:32.079
I will not let silence wrap itself around my
indecision.

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:36.241
I will tell Christian that he is a lion, a
sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:39.704
I will ask that homeless man what his name is and
how his day was,

00:03:39.743 --> 00:03:42.444
because sometimes all people want to be is
human.

00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:46.707
I will tell that woman that my students can talk
about transcendentalism like their last name

00:03:46.728 --> 00:03:50.270
was Thoreau, and just because you watched one
episode of The Wire doesn't mean you know

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.311
anything about my kids, so this year,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.861
Instead of giving something up,

00:03:55.923 --> 00:03:59.425
I will live every day as if there were a
microphone tucked under my tongue,

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:06.973
a stage on the underside of my inhibition.
Because who has to have a soapbox when all you've

00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:07.772
ever needed

00:04:09.175 --> 00:04:10.756
is your voice? Thank you.
