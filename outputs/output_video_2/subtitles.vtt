00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:18.048
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in a 1968 speech
where he reflects upon the civil rights

00:00:18.088 --> 00:00:23.530
movement, states, in the end, we will remember
not the words of our enemies,

00:00:24.652 --> 00:00:30.554
but the silence of our friends. As a teacher,
I've internalized this message. Every day,

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:35.017
all around us, we see the consequences of
silence manifest themselves in the form of

00:00:35.057 --> 00:00:40.582
discrimination, violence, genocide, and war.
In the classroom,

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:45.143
I challenge my students to explore the silences
in their own lives through poetry.

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:50.645
We work together to fill those spaces, to
recognize them, to name them,

00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:53.765
to understand that they don't have to be sources
of shame.

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:58.786
In an effort to create a culture within my
classroom where students feel safe sharing the

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:03.828
intimacies of their own silences, I have four
core principles posted on the board that sits in

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:08.989
the front of my class, which every student signs
at the beginning of the year. Read critically.

00:01:09.746 --> 00:01:13.207
write consciously, speak clearly, tell your
truth.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.069
I find myself thinking a lot about that last
point, tell your truth.

00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:22.471
And I realized that if I was going to ask my
students to speak up,

00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:28.073
I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest
with them about the times where I failed to do so.

00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:34.817
So I tell them that growing up, as a kid in a
Catholic family in New Orleans, During Lent,

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.341
I was always taught that the most meaningful
thing one could do was to give something up,

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:44.245
sacrifice something you typically indulge in
to prove to God you understand His sanctity.

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:49.489
I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries,
French kisses, and everything in between.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:57.516
But one year, I gave up speaking, figured the
most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own

00:01:57.615 --> 00:02:02.640
voice, but it was like I hadn't realized that I
had given that up a long time ago.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.091
I spent so much of my life telling people the
things they wanted to hear instead of the things

00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:12.120
they needed to, told myself I wasn't meant to be
anyone's conscience because I still had to

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.247
figure out being my own, so sometimes, I just
wouldn't say anything,

00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:22.131
appeasing ignorance with my silence, unaware
that validation doesn't need words to endorse

00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:24.793
its existence. When Christian was beat up for
being gay,

00:02:25.032 --> 00:02:28.915
I put my hands in my pocket and walked with my head
down as if I didn't even notice.

00:02:29.195 --> 00:02:33.419
Couldn't use my locker for weeks because the
bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I had put on

00:02:33.438 --> 00:02:36.820
my lips. When the homeless man on the corner
looked at me with eyes up,

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:39.382
merely searching for an affirmation that he was
worth seeing,

00:02:39.622 --> 00:02:43.025
I was more concerned with touching the screen of
my apple than actually feeding him one.

00:02:43.064 --> 00:02:46.026
When the woman at the fundraising gala said, I'm
so proud of you.

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:49.127
It must be so hard teaching those poor,
unintelligent kids.

00:02:49.228 --> 00:02:53.209
I bit my lip because apparently we needed her
money more than my students needed their

00:02:53.288 --> 00:03:00.170
dignity. We spend so much time listening to the
things people are saying that we rarely pay

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.506
attention to the things they don't. Silence is
the residue of fear. It is filling your flaws,

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:12.288
gut-rich guillotine, your tongue. It is the air
retreating from your chest because it doesn't

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.931
feel safe in your lungs. Silence is Rwandan
genocide. Silence is Katrina.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.692
It is what you hear when there aren't enough body
bags left.

00:03:19.752 --> 00:03:24.655
It is the sound after the noose is already tied.
It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege.

00:03:24.914 --> 00:03:28.937
It is pain. There is no time to pick your battles
when your battles have already picked you.

00:03:29.016 --> 00:03:32.079
I will not let silence wrap itself around my
indecision.

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:36.241
I will tell Christian that he is a lion, a
sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:39.704
I will ask that homeless man what his name is and
how his day was,

00:03:39.743 --> 00:03:42.444
because sometimes all people want to be is
human.

00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:46.707
I will tell that woman that my students can talk
about transcendentalism like their last name

00:03:46.728 --> 00:03:50.270
was Thoreau, and just because you watched one
episode of The Wire doesn't mean you know

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.861
anything about my kids, so this year, Instead of
giving something up,

00:03:55.923 --> 00:03:59.425
I will live every day as if there were a
microphone tucked under my tongue,

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:06.973
a stage on the underside of my inhibition.
Because who has to have a soapbox when all you've

00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:10.756
ever needed is your voice? Thank you.
