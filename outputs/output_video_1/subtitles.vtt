00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:04.790
Today, I want to tell you three stories from my
life. That's it. No big deal.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.270
Just three stories.

00:00:10.332 --> 00:00:13.131
The first story is about connecting the dots.

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:18.053
I dropped out of Reed College after the first six
months,

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:22.375
but then stayed around as a drop-in for another
18 months or so before I really quit.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:24.855
So why'd I drop out?

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:28.036
It started before I was born.

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:33.250
My biological mother was a young, unwed
graduate student,

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.451
and she decided to put me up for adoption.

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:40.113
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted
by college graduates,

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:44.817
so everything was all set for me to be adopted at
birth by a lawyer and his wife.

00:00:46.238 --> 00:00:50.661
Except that when I popped out, they decided at
the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:56.686
So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a
call in the middle of the night asking,

00:00:57.728 --> 00:01:00.590
we've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want
him?

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.191
They said, of course.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:10.355
My biological mother found out later that my
mother had never graduated from college and

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:12.516
that my father had never graduated from high
school.

00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:19.903
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
She only relented a few months later when my

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:25.769
parents promised that I would go to college.
This was the start in my life.

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:34.518
And 17 years later, I did go to college. But I
naively chose a college that was almost as

00:01:34.578 --> 00:01:35.719
expensive as Stanford.

00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:40.805
And all of my working class parents' savings
were being spent on my college tuition.

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:47.215
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life,

00:01:47.856 --> 00:01:52.040
and no idea how college was going to help me
figure it out. And here I was,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.942
spending all the money my parents had saved
their entire life.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:02:00.927
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would
all work out okay.

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.230
It was pretty scary at the time, but looking
back,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.412
it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:14.207
The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the
required classes that didn't interest me and

00:02:14.247 --> 00:02:17.610
begin dropping in on the ones that looked far
more interesting.

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:23.995
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm
room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms.

00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:28.237
I returned Coke bottles for the five-cent
deposits to buy food with.

00:02:29.057 --> 00:02:34.301
And I would walk the seven miles across town
every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at

00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:35.323
the Hare Krishna temple.

00:02:36.502 --> 00:02:42.223
I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by
following my curiosity and intuition turned

00:02:42.283 --> 00:02:45.705
out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one
example.

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:51.967
Reed College at that time offered perhaps the
best calligraphy instruction in the country.

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:58.168
Throughout the campus, every poster, every
label on every drawer was beautifully hand

00:02:58.187 --> 00:03:02.889
calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and
didn't have to take the normal classes,

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:06.556
I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn
how to do this.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.038
I learned about serif and sans-serif
typefaces,

00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:13.679
about varying the amount of space between
different letter combinations,

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.479
about what makes great typography great.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.100
It was beautiful, historical, artistically
subtle in a way that science can't capture,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.162
and I found it fascinating.

00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:30.323
None of this had even a hope of any practical
application in my life.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:35.579
But 10 years later, when we were designing the
first Macintosh computer,

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.901
it all came back to me. And we designed it all into
the Mac.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.882
It was the first computer with beautiful
typography.

00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:46.743
If I had never dropped in on that single course in
college,

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:50.925
the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces
or proportionally spaced fonts.

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:55.967
And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's
likely that no personal computer would have

00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:56.087
them.

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.584
If I had never dropped out, I would have never
dropped in on that calligraphy class,

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:06.530
and personal computers might not have the
wonderful typography that they do. Of course,

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.475
it was impossible to connect the dots looking
forward when I was in college, but it was very,

00:04:11.556 --> 00:04:15.221
very clear looking backwards 10 years later.
Again,

00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:19.862
you can't connect the dots looking forward. You
can only connect them looking backwards.

00:04:20.603 --> 00:04:23.824
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow
connect in your future.

00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:28.767
You have to trust in something, your gut,
destiny, life, karma, whatever,

00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:34.129
because believing that the dots will connect
down the road will give you the confidence to

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.932
follow your heart even when it leads you off the
well-worn path,

00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:39.913
and that will make all the difference.

00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:47.148
My second story is about love and loss.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.791
I was lucky. I found what I love to do early in
life.

00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:58.975
Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage
when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years,

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:03.858
Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage
into a $2 billion company with over 4,000

00:05:03.858 --> 00:05:08.903
employees. We'd just released our finest
creation, the Macintosh, a year earlier,

00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:12.425
and I'd just turned 30. And then I got fired.

00:05:14.211 --> 00:05:19.475
How can you get fired from a company you started?
Well, as Apple grew,

00:05:19.675 --> 00:05:23.317
we hired someone who I thought was very talented
to run the company with me.

00:05:23.817 --> 00:05:27.860
And for the first year or so, things went well.
But then our visions of the future began to

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.461
diverge, and eventually we had a falling out.
When we did,

00:05:31.822 --> 00:05:37.564
our board of directors sided with him. And so at
30, I was out, and very publicly out.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:42.447
What had been the focus of my entire adult life
was gone, and it was devastating.

00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:48.269
I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I
felt that I had let the previous generation of

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.252
entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the
baton as it was being passed to me.

00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:58.478
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried
to apologize for screwing up so badly.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:02.862
I was a very public failure and I even thought
about running away from the valley.

00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:05.803
But something slowly began to dawn on me.

00:06:06.884 --> 00:06:08.386
I still loved what I did.

00:06:10.187 --> 00:06:14.343
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that
one bit. I'd been rejected,

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:15.725
but I was still in love.

00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:18.565
And so I decided to start over.

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:23.928
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that
getting fired from Apple was the best thing that

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.088
could have ever happened to me.

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:30.851
The heaviness of being successful was replaced
by the lightness of being a beginner again,

00:06:31.312 --> 00:06:35.665
less sure about everything. It freed me to enter
one of the most creative periods of my life.

00:06:36.545 --> 00:06:40.987
During the next five years, I started a company
named Next, another company named Pixar,

00:06:41.387 --> 00:06:43.829
and fell in love with an amazing woman who would
become my wife.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.833
Pixar went on to create the world's first
computer animated feature film, Toy Story,

00:06:49.434 --> 00:06:52.495
and is now the most successful animation studio
in the world.

00:06:54.985 --> 00:06:59.788
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought
NeXT, and I returned to Apple,

00:07:00.288 --> 00:07:04.050
and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the
heart of Apple's current renaissance.

00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:07.512
And Lorene and I have a wonderful family
together.

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:12.495
I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened
if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:16.197
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the
patient needed it.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:22.161
Sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a
brick. Don't lose faith.

00:07:23.283 --> 00:07:26.704
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me
going was that I loved what I did.

00:07:27.324 --> 00:07:32.144
You've got to find what you love, and that is as
true for work as it is for your lovers.

00:07:33.206 --> 00:07:35.225
Your work is going to fill a large part of your
life,

00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:39.567
and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do
what you believe is great work,

00:07:40.108 --> 00:07:45.348
and the only way to do great work is to love what
you do. If you haven't found it yet,

00:07:45.728 --> 00:07:50.175
keep looking, and don't settle. As with all
matters of the heart,

00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:53.776
you'll know when you find it. And like any great
relationship,

00:07:54.117 --> 00:07:59.439
it just gets better and better as the years roll
on. So keep looking, don't settle.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.081
My third story is about death.

00:08:06.523 --> 00:08:12.706
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something
like, if you live each day as if it was your last,

00:08:13.165 --> 00:08:14.906
someday you'll most certainly be right.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:20.641
It made an impression on me, and since then, for
the past 33 years,

00:08:21.182 --> 00:08:23.463
I've looked in the mirror every morning and
asked myself,

00:08:24.043 --> 00:08:28.946
if today were the last day of my life, would I want
to do what I am about to do today?

00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:34.849
And whenever the answer has been no for too many
days in a row, I know I need to change something.

00:08:36.192 --> 00:08:41.034
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most
important tool I've ever encountered to help me

00:08:41.095 --> 00:08:42.475
make the big choices in life.

00:08:43.517 --> 00:08:48.019
Because almost everything, all external
expectations, all pride,

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:52.964
all fear of embarrassment or failure, these
things just fall away in the face of death.

00:08:53.772 --> 00:08:59.177
leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die is the best

00:08:59.236 --> 00:09:05.001
way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have
something to lose. You are already naked.

00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:07.864
There is no reason not to follow your heart.

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:15.490
No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to
heaven don't want to die to get there.

00:09:16.583 --> 00:09:21.764
And yet, death is the destination we all share.
No one has ever escaped it.

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:28.407
And that is as it should be, because death is very
likely the single best invention of life.

00:09:29.388 --> 00:09:32.928
It's life's change agent. It clears out the old
to make way for the new.

00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:35.769
Right now, the new is you.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.571
But someday, not too long from now, you will
gradually become the old and be cleared away.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.961
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.
Your time is limited,

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:53.725
so don't waste it living someone else's life.
Don't be trapped by dogma,

00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:56.467
which is living with the results of other
people's thinking.

00:09:57.368 --> 00:10:02.511
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown
out your own inner voice. And most important,

00:10:02.873 --> 00:10:05.193
have the courage to follow your heart and
intuition.

00:10:05.794 --> 00:10:12.059
They somehow already know what you truly want to
become. Everything else is secondary.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.202
Stay hungry, stay foolish.
