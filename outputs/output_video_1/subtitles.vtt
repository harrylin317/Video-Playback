00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:04.790
Today, I want to tell you three stories from my
life. That's it. No big deal.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:13.131
Just three stories. The first story is about
connecting the dots.

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:18.053
I dropped out of Reed College after the first six
months,

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:22.375
but then stayed around as a drop-in for another
18 months or so before I really quit.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:31.888
So why'd I drop out? It started before I was born.
My biological mother was a young,

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:35.451
unwed graduate student, and she decided to put
me up for adoption.

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:40.113
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted
by college graduates,

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:44.817
so everything was all set for me to be adopted at
birth by a lawyer and his wife.

00:00:46.238 --> 00:00:50.661
Except that when I popped out, they decided at
the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:56.686
So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a
call in the middle of the night asking,

00:00:57.728 --> 00:01:03.191
we've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want
him? They said, of course.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:10.355
My biological mother found out later that my
mother had never graduated from college and

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:12.516
that my father had never graduated from high
school.

00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:19.903
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
She only relented a few months later when my

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:29.492
parents promised that I would go to college.
This was the start in my life. And 17 years later,

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:35.719
I did go to college. But I naively chose a college
that was almost as expensive as Stanford.

00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:40.805
And all of my working class parents' savings
were being spent on my college tuition.

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:47.215
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life,

00:01:47.856 --> 00:01:52.040
and no idea how college was going to help me
figure it out. And here I was,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.942
spending all the money my parents had saved
their entire life.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:02:00.927
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would
all work out okay.

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.230
It was pretty scary at the time, but looking
back,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.485
it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The
minute I dropped out,

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:15.568
I could stop taking the required classes that
didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.932
ones that looked far more interesting. It
wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room,

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:26.836
so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms. I
returned Coke bottles for the five-cent

00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:32.881
deposits to buy food with. And I would walk the
seven miles across town every Sunday night to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.122
get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna
temple. I loved it.

00:02:38.102 --> 00:02:42.584
And much of what I stumbled into by following my
curiosity and intuition turned out to be

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:49.885
priceless later on. Let me give you one example.
Reed College at that time offered perhaps the

00:02:49.945 --> 00:02:54.967
best calligraphy instruction in the country.
Throughout the campus, every poster,

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:58.808
every label on every drawer was beautifully
hand calligraphed.

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:02.889
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take
the normal classes,

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:06.556
I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn
how to do this.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.038
I learned about serif and sans-serif
typefaces,

00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:13.679
about varying the amount of space between
different letter combinations,

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:19.639
about what makes great typography great. It was
beautiful, historical,

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.162
artistically subtle in a way that science can't
capture, and I found it fascinating.

00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:32.796
None of this had even a hope of any practical
application in my life. But 10 years later,

00:03:33.138 --> 00:03:37.139
when we were designing the first Macintosh
computer, it all came back to me.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.882
And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the
first computer with beautiful typography.

00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:46.743
If I had never dropped in on that single course in
college,

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:50.925
the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces
or proportionally spaced fonts.

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:55.967
And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's
likely that no personal computer would have

00:03:55.987 --> 00:04:01.584
them. If I had never dropped out, I would have
never dropped in on that calligraphy class,

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:06.530
and personal computers might not have the
wonderful typography that they do. Of course,

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.475
it was impossible to connect the dots looking
forward when I was in college, but it was very,

00:04:11.556 --> 00:04:15.221
very clear looking backwards 10 years later.
Again,

00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:19.862
you can't connect the dots looking forward. You
can only connect them looking backwards.

00:04:20.603 --> 00:04:23.824
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow
connect in your future.

00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:28.767
You have to trust in something, your gut,
destiny, life, karma, whatever,

00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:34.129
because believing that the dots will connect
down the road will give you the confidence to

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.932
follow your heart even when it leads you off the
well-worn path,

00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:49.810
and that will make all the difference. My second
story is about love and loss. I was lucky.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.334
I found what I love to do early in life. Woz and I
started Apple in my parents' garage when I was

00:04:56.334 --> 00:05:02.218
20. We worked hard, and in 10 years, Apple had
grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:07.201
billion company with over 4,000 employees.
We'd just released our finest creation,

00:05:07.382 --> 00:05:12.425
the Macintosh, a year earlier, and I'd just
turned 30. And then I got fired.

00:05:14.211 --> 00:05:19.475
How can you get fired from a company you started?
Well, as Apple grew,

00:05:19.675 --> 00:05:23.317
we hired someone who I thought was very talented
to run the company with me.

00:05:23.817 --> 00:05:27.860
And for the first year or so, things went well.
But then our visions of the future began to

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.461
diverge, and eventually we had a falling out.
When we did,

00:05:31.822 --> 00:05:37.564
our board of directors sided with him. And so at
30, I was out, and very publicly out.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:42.447
What had been the focus of my entire adult life
was gone, and it was devastating.

00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:48.269
I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I
felt that I had let the previous generation of

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.252
entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the
baton as it was being passed to me.

00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:58.478
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried
to apologize for screwing up so badly.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:02.862
I was a very public failure and I even thought
about running away from the valley.

00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:08.386
But something slowly began to dawn on me. I still
loved what I did.

00:06:10.187 --> 00:06:14.343
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that
one bit. I'd been rejected,

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:20.846
but I was still in love. And so I decided to start
over. I didn't see it then,

00:06:21.507 --> 00:06:24.889
but it turned out that getting fired from Apple
was the best thing that could have ever happened

00:06:24.908 --> 00:06:30.572
to me. The heaviness of being successful was
replaced by the lightness of being a beginner

00:06:30.632 --> 00:06:35.384
again, less sure about everything. It freed me
to enter one of the most creative periods of my

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:39.086
life. During the next five years, I started a
company named Next,

00:06:39.646 --> 00:06:43.829
another company named Pixar, and fell in love
with an amazing woman who would become my wife.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.833
Pixar went on to create the world's first
computer animated feature film, Toy Story,

00:06:49.434 --> 00:06:56.466
and is now the most successful animation studio
in the world. In a remarkable turn of events,

00:06:57.387 --> 00:07:02.350
Apple bought NeXT, and I returned to Apple, and
the technology we developed at NeXT is at the

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.512
heart of Apple's current renaissance. And
Lorene and I have a wonderful family together.

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:12.495
I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened
if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:16.197
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the
patient needed it.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:22.161
Sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a
brick. Don't lose faith.

00:07:23.283 --> 00:07:26.704
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me
going was that I loved what I did.

00:07:27.324 --> 00:07:32.144
You've got to find what you love, and that is as
true for work as it is for your lovers.

00:07:33.206 --> 00:07:35.225
Your work is going to fill a large part of your
life,

00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:39.567
and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do
what you believe is great work,

00:07:40.108 --> 00:07:45.348
and the only way to do great work is to love what
you do. If you haven't found it yet,

00:07:45.728 --> 00:07:50.175
keep looking, and don't settle. As with all
matters of the heart,

00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:53.776
you'll know when you find it. And like any great
relationship,

00:07:54.117 --> 00:07:59.439
it just gets better and better as the years roll
on. So keep looking, don't settle.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.725
My third story is about death. When I was 17, I
read a quote that went something like,

00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:14.906
if you live each day as if it was your last,
someday you'll most certainly be right.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:20.641
It made an impression on me, and since then, for
the past 33 years,

00:08:21.182 --> 00:08:23.463
I've looked in the mirror every morning and
asked myself,

00:08:24.043 --> 00:08:28.946
if today were the last day of my life, would I want
to do what I am about to do today?

00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:34.849
And whenever the answer has been no for too many
days in a row, I know I need to change something.

00:08:36.192 --> 00:08:41.034
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most
important tool I've ever encountered to help me

00:08:41.095 --> 00:08:46.999
make the big choices in life. Because almost
everything, all external expectations,

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.942
all pride, all fear of embarrassment or
failure,

00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:55.594
these things just fall away in the face of death.
leaving only what is truly important.

00:08:56.413 --> 00:09:02.058
Remembering that you are going to die is the best
way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:07.864
something to lose. You are already naked. There
is no reason not to follow your heart.

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:16.943
No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to
heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet,

00:09:17.744 --> 00:09:24.105
death is the destination we all share. No one has
ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:30.648
because death is very likely the single best
invention of life. It's life's change agent.

00:09:30.947 --> 00:09:37.470
It clears out the old to make way for the new.
Right now, the new is you. But someday,

00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:41.571
not too long from now, you will gradually become
the old and be cleared away.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.961
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.
Your time is limited,

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:53.725
so don't waste it living someone else's life.
Don't be trapped by dogma,

00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:56.467
which is living with the results of other
people's thinking.

00:09:57.368 --> 00:10:02.511
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown
out your own inner voice. And most important,

00:10:02.873 --> 00:10:05.193
have the courage to follow your heart and
intuition.

00:10:05.794 --> 00:10:12.059
They somehow already know what you truly want to
become. Everything else is secondary.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.202
Stay hungry, stay foolish.
