Wow, what an audience. But if I'm being honest, I
don't care what you think of my talk. I don't.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:23.585
I care what the Internet thinks of my talk.
Because they're the ones who get it seen and get

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:28.007
it shared. And I think that's where most people
get it wrong. They're talking to you, here,

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:35.067
instead of talking to you, random person
scrolling Facebook. Thanks for the click.

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:42.622
You see, back in 2009, we all had these weird
little things called attention spans. Yeah,

00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:45.265
they're gone. They're gone. We killed them.
They're dead.

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:50.807
I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an
18-minute TED talk. It's been years,

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:57.030
literally years. So if you're giving a TED talk,
keep it quick. I'm doing mine in under a minute.

00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:00.953
I'm at 44 seconds right now. That means we've got
time for one final joke.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:06.355
Why are balloons so expensive? Inflation.
