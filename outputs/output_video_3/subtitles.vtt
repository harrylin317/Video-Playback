Wow,

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:17.044
what an audience. But if I'm being honest, I
don't care what you think of my talk.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.484
I don't. I care what the Internet thinks of my
talk.

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:24.006
Because they're the ones who get it seen and get
it shared.

00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:28.007
And I think that's where most people get it
wrong. They're talking to you, here,

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:33.167
instead of talking to you, random person
scrolling Facebook.

00:00:34.427 --> 00:00:35.067
Thanks for the click.

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:41.310
You see, back in 2009, we all had these weird
little things called attention spans.

00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:45.265
Yeah, they're gone. They're gone. We killed
them. They're dead.

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:50.807
I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an
18-minute TED talk. It's been years,

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:57.030
literally years. So if you're giving a TED talk,
keep it quick. I'm doing mine in under a minute.

00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:00.953
I'm at 44 seconds right now. That means we've got
time for one final joke.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.015
Why are balloons so expensive?

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:06.355
Inflation.
